Snakes And Ladder Game
This is a regular snakes and ladders game. Each player starts with square 1. Turn-wise each player throws a dice and based on the dice result, the player moves that many squares ahead.

Once you land on top of a snake you go down a few squares, and move up if you land  on the bottom of a ladder.
